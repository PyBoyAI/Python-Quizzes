## Python Quiz 0001
Are the following statements valid in Python 3?

a, b = 0 ** 3, 0 / 3 <br>
print(a, b) <br>

a) Yes<br>
b) No

The correct answer is **a) Yes**

The Python statement a, b = 0 ** 3, 0 / 3 is valid because it uses tuple unpacking to assign values. 0 ** 3 is 0 (since 0 to any power is 0), and 0 / 3 is also 0 (since 0 divided by any number is 0). Thus, a and b both get assigned the value 0.
